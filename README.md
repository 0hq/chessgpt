## ChessGPT + Stockfish

Forked from will depue's [0hq/chessgpt](https://github.com/0hq/chessgpt), added Stockfish (in browser, using WASM, from [hi-ogawa/Stockfish](https://github.com/hi-ogawa/Stockfish)).

I similarly apologise for very hacked together code, as below.

Try it:

[chessgpt-stockfish.vercel.app](https://chessgpt-stockfish.vercel.app/) (with stockfish)
